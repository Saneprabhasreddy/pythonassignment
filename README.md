what is git and github:
Git is a distributed version control system that allows users to keep track of changes made to their code over time. It was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel. Git is free and open-source, making it a popular choice for both personal and commercial projects.

Git uses a decentralized approach to version control, which means that each user has a local copy of the entire repository, including its complete history. This allows users to work offline and makes collaboration easier, as each user can make changes to their local copy of the code without affecting the code on the remote repository until they choose to push their changes.

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a hosting service for Git repositories. It was launched in 2008 and quickly became one of the most popular platforms for open-source projects. GitHub provides a range of features that make it easier for developers to collaborate and manage their code, including pull requests, issue tracking, and code reviews.

Some of the key features of GitHub include: 1.Repository Hosting: GitHub provides hosting for Git repositories, making it easy for developers to store and manage their code online. Users can create public or private repositories, depending on their needs.

2.Pull Requests: GitHub makes it easy for developers to collaborate on code changes by allowing them to create pull requests. Pull requests are a way for developers to propose changes to a repository and get feedback from other users.

3.Issue Tracking: GitHub provides a built-in issue tracking system that allows developers to track bugs, feature requests, and other issues related to their code. Users can create issues, assign them to team members, and track their progress.

4.Code Reviews: GitHub makes it easy for developers to review each other's code before it is merged into the main repository. This helps ensure that code is of high quality and free of bugs.

5.Integrations: GitHub integrates with a range of other tools and services, including continuous integration and deployment tools, chat platforms, and project management tools.

6.Community: GitHub has a large and active community of developers who share code, collaborate on projects, and provide support to each other. This community is one of the key strengths of GitHub, and it has helped make the platform one of the most popular places for open-source development.

In addition to these features, GitHub also provides a range of tools for managing and organizing code, including code search, code hosting, and code sharing. It also offers various pricing plans, including free plans for personal and small team projects, and paid plans for larger teams and enterprises.

Overall, Git and GitHub are powerful tools for managing code and collaborating with other developers. They have become essential for software development and have helped to facilitate the growth of open-source software.

1.electricity bill :
This program calculates the electricity bill based on the user's 
current and previous meter readings. The rate per unit depends on the total units consumed. If the total units are less than or equal to 200, the rate is 3.0. If the total units are less than or equal to 250, the rate is 3.0 for the first 200 units and 4.5 for the remaining units. If the total units are less than or equal to 400, the rate is 3.0 for the first 200 units, 4.5 for the next 50 units, and 6.5 for the remaining units. If the total units are greater than 400, the rate is 3.0 for the first 200 units, 4.5 for the next 50 units, 6.5 for the next 150 units, and 7.0 for the remaining units. The program then prints the total bill.

2.fibonacci series:

This program prints the Fibonacci series up to a given number 
of terms. The user inputs the number of terms they want to generate and the program uses a while loop to calculate each term in the series by adding the previous two terms. The first two terms are always 0 and 1 and are printed outside the loop. The loop continues until the number of terms specified by the user is reached, and each new term in the series is printed.

3.floyd's triangle :

This code prints Floyd's triangle, which is a triangular array of
natural numbers. The user is prompted to enter the number of rows they want in the triangle. Then, using two nested for loops, the code prints the numbers in a triangular pattern, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 in each row.

4.finding number of ovals,consonents,digits and words in given string :

This program takes an input string and counts the number of vowels, consonants, digits, and words in it. It uses two lists to define the vowels and digits and then loops through the characters of the string. If a character is a digit or vowel, the respective counter is incremented. If a space character is encountered, the word counter is incremented. The number of consonants is calculated as the difference between the length of the string and the sum of the vowels, spaces, and digits. Finally, the program outputs the count of words, vowels, consonants, and digits.

5.integer to raoman number :

This program converts a given integer into a Roman numeral. It has four arrays, each representing the ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands places of Roman numerals. The user inputs an integer, which is then formatted with leading zeroes to ensure it has four digits. The program extracts the value in each digit and uses the corresponding values in the four arrays to build the Roman numeral equivalent of the integer. Finally, the Roman numeral is printed to the console.

6.to find year is a leap year or not :
This code takes an input year from the user and checks whether it's a leap year or not. If the year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or if it's divisible by 400, then it's considered as a leap year. Otherwise, it's not a leap year. Finally, it prints the result.

7.palidrome :

This program checks if a given string is a palindrome or not. It takes a string input from the user, reverses the string, and checks if the reversed string is equal to the original string. If they are equal, it prints that the given string is a palindrome, otherwise, it prints that the given string is not a palindrome.

8.pascaltriangle :

This program prints the Pascal triangle up to the number of rows specified by the user. It first takes an input from the user specifying the number of rows to be printed. It then uses two loops to iterate over each row and column of the triangle. The first loop prints out the appropriate number of spaces before the numbers, while the second loop calculates and prints the numbers themselves using the formula for calculating a number in the Pascal triangle. The program uses formatted string output to ensure that each number takes up the same amount of space, making the triangle more visually appealing.

9.to find whethwe num is a prime or not :

This program prints the Pascal triangle up to the number of rows specified by the user. It first takes an input from the user specifying the number of rows to be printed. It then uses two loops to iterate over each row and column of the triangle. The first loop prints out the appropriate number of spaces before the numbers, while the second loop calculates and prints the numbers themselves using the formula for calculating a number in the Pascal triangle. The program uses formatted string output to ensure that each number takes up the same amount of space, making the triangle more visually appealing.

10.checks if the second string is substring of the first string :

This is a program that checks if the second string entered by the user is a substring of the first string entered. It works by iterating through the first string and checking if the first character of the second string matches any character in the first string. If a match is found, the program then checks if the remaining characters of the second string match the subsequent characters in the first string. If all characters match, the program prints that the second string is a substring of the first string. If there is no match, it prints that the second string is not a substring of the first string.
